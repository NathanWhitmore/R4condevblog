### About me

Hi, my name is Nathan Whitmore, and I’m a conservation scientist and practitioner. Over the years I have worked variously as a fisheries observer, conservation ranger, and, from 2012 to 2018, as an in-country adviser for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Papua New Guinea programme. I am currently based in New Zealand.

### R for Conservation and Development
I have an avid interest in the R statistical programming language. Realising that there wasn't a good R resource for conservation and development practitioners I wrote **R for Conservation and Development Projects: A Primer for Practitioners** which came out in 2021.
