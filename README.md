Realising that there wasn't a good R resource for conservation and development practitioners I wrote **R for Conservation and Development Projects: A Primer for Practitioners** which came out in 2021.

![book cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NathanWhitmore/Reproducible/main/book%20cover.jpg)

The book is available at all major book distributors (kindle, ebook, paper back, and hardback versions) including:

- [The Book Depository](https://www.bookdepository.com/R-for-Conservation-Development-Projects-Nathan-Whitmore/9780367205485?ref=grid-view&qid=1611283102040&sr=1-1)
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Conservation-Development-Projects-Chapman-Hall/dp/0367205483)
- [Booktopia](https://www.booktopia.com.au/r-for-conservation-and-development-projects-nathan-whitmore/book/9780367205485.html)

Additionally, I am working on a free bookdown (online) version which will be publicly available in early 2021.

### About the book
This book is aimed at conservation and development practitioners who need to learn and use R in a part-time professional context. It gives people with a non-technical background a set of skills to graph, map, and model in R. It also provides background on data integration in project management and covers fundamental statistical concepts. The book aims to demystify R and give practitioners the confidence to use it.

**Key Features:**

* Viewing data science as part of a greater knowledge and decision making system
* Foundation sections on inference, evidence, and data integration
* Plain English explanations of R functions
* Relatable examples which are typical of activities undertaken by conservation and development organisations in the developing world
* Worked examples showing how data analysis can be incorporated into project reports
