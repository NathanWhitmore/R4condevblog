## About me 

Hi, my name is Nathan Whitmore, and I’m a conservation scientist and practitioner. Over the years I have worked variously as a fisheries observer, conservation ranger, and, from 2012 to 2018, as an in-country adviser for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Papua New Guinea programme. My professional interests include data science, evidence-based decision making, sustainable use of wildlife, and traditional natural resource management.

I have an avid interest in the R statistical programming language. Realising that there wasn't a good R resource for conservation and development practitioners I wrote **R for Conservation and Development Projects: A Primer for Practitioners.**
