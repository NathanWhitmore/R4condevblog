### About me
My name is Nathan Whitmore, and I’m a conservation scientist and practitioner. Over the years I have worked variously as a fisheries observer, conservation ranger, and, from 2012 to 2018, as an in-country adviser for the Wildlife Conservation Society’s Papua New Guinea programme. I have an avid interest in the R statistical programming language. I am currently based in New Zealand. My professional interests include data science, evidence-based decision making, sustainable use of wildlife, and traditional natural resource management.
